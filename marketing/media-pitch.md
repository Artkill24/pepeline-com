**Subject:** Exclusive: First AI crypto tool with fully transparent algorithms (73% accuracy)

---

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm reaching out because I think your readers at [Publication] would be interested in a new development in crypto AI tools.

**The Story:**

We just launched Pepeline — the first cryptocurrency intelligence platform that shows exactly how its AI works.

While most tools hide behind "proprietary algorithms," we open-source everything and provide full explanations for every trading signal.

**Why This Matters:**

The crypto AI space is full of unverifiable claims. "90% accuracy" promises with zero proof. Algorithms you can't audit. Platforms that require custody of your funds.

We're doing the opposite:
- 73% accuracy (backtested, documented, verifiable)
- Full signal explanations (feature importance breakdown)
- Non-custodial (users control their crypto)
- Open-source code (audit it yourself)

**The Numbers:**

- 73% directional accuracy over 30-day backtests
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.8 (risk-adjusted returns)
- +23% vs naive baseline models
- 250+ coins tracked across multiple blockchains
- $25k in Alchemy credits powering premium features

**Why Now:**

As AI tools proliferate in crypto, transparency becomes crucial. We're raising the bar for what "AI trading" should mean — verifiable claims, auditable code, and user control.

**Available for Interview:**

I'm happy to:
- Provide a demo walkthrough
- Explain the technical methodology
- Discuss why transparency matters in crypto AI
- Share exclusive data/screenshots

**Live Now:**
You can try it at pepeline.com (no signup needed)

Would you be interested in covering this? I can send over a press kit with screenshots, technical details, and founder quotes.

Best regards,
Saad
Lead Developer, Pepeline

P.S. - Our code is public on GitHub if your tech team wants to verify our claims: github.com/Artkill24/pepeline-com
