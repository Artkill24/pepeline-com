## Full Description

### The Problem
Most crypto "AI" tools are black boxes. They promise moon returns but won't show you how they work. You're expected to blindly trust algorithms you can't audit, accuracy claims you can't verify, and signals you can't understand.

That's BS. We built something better.

## First Comment (Maker Comment)
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Saad, and I built Pepeline because I was tired of crypto "AI" tools that:
- Make wild accuracy claims with zero proof
- Hide their algorithms in black boxes
- Require custody of your funds
- Charge $100+/month for basic signals

Pepeline is different:

**✅ 73% accuracy** — backtested, documented, auditable
**✅ Fully transparent** — see why every signal was generated
**✅ Non-custodial** — we never touch your crypto
**✅ Open source** — audit the code yourself on GitHub
**✅ Free forever** — premium features coming, core always free

The Explainable AI dashboard (pepeline.com/explain) shows exactly how each signal is calculated — sentiment index weight, whale activity impact, gas price influence, volume confirmation. No black boxes.

We're powered by $25k in Alchemy credits, tracking 250+ coins across multiple chains (Ethereum, Solana, Base).

Would love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

🐸 Let's make crypto trading more transparent.
