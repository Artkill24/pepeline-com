🚀 Launching Pepeline: Open-Source Crypto Intelligence with 73% Accuracy

After months of development, I'm excited to share Pepeline — an AI-powered cryptocurrency trading platform that prioritizes transparency over hype.

**The Problem:**
Most crypto "AI" tools are black boxes. Proprietary algorithms, unverified accuracy claims, and custody risks are the norm.

**Our Solution:**
Pepeline combines real-time market data with explainable AI to generate trading signals you can actually understand and verify.

**Key Technical Features:**
- 73% backtest accuracy (Sharpe Ratio: 1.8)
- Explainable AI dashboard showing feature importance
- Non-custodial architecture (we never touch your funds)
- Open-source codebase on GitHub
- Multi-chain analytics (Ethereum, Solana, Base)
- $25k in Alchemy credits powering premium features

**Tech Stack:**
Next.js 14, Supabase, Alchemy API, CoinGecko, Gemini AI, Vercel Edge Functions

**Validation Methodology:**
Walk-forward optimization, out-of-sample testing, Sharpe Ratio analysis, bias detection, and comparison vs naive baselines.

Every signal includes:
✓ Feature importance breakdown
✓ Confidence levels
✓ Bias warnings
✓ Full methodology transparency

**Why This Matters:**
The crypto space needs more transparency, not more black boxes. By open-sourcing our approach and rigorously testing claims, we're raising the bar for what "AI trading tools" should provide.

💡 Tired of crypto "AI" tools that won't show you how they work?

I built Pepeline — a trading intelligence platform with one rule: radical transparency.

❌ No black boxes
❌ No custody of your funds  
❌ No unverified accuracy claims

✅ 73% backtested accuracy
✅ Full explanations for every signal
✅ Open-source code you can audit
✅ Non-custodial (you control your crypto)

Every trading signal shows:
- Why it was generated
- Which factors contributed most
- Confidence levels
- Potential biases

Because "trust us bro" isn't good enough anymore.
