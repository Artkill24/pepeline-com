=== Day 2 (2026-02-24) ===
Test completed: 00:15 UTC
Fear & Greed: 8 (EXTREME FEAR, +3 from Day 1)
ToolLab Signal: NEUTRAL (4 acc vs 4 dist - still balanced)
Pepeline Signal: BUY (strength 42)
Combined: WEAK alignment (hold recommended)

Observation: Market showing slight recovery (5→8) but whales remain undecided. 
Combined approach correctly prevents premature entry during whale indecision.
This validates the methodology - sentiment alone would trigger buy, but whale 
neutrality suggests waiting for stronger confirmation.

Pattern to watch: When will whales shift from balanced? That's the real signal.
